"Responsive and accessible mini-site for EcoDrone environmental monitoring project, built with HTML5 and CSS3, featuring smart forms and CSS-only interactive components."
# EcoDrone Responsive Mini-Site

## Project Overview

EcoDrone is a fictional environmental monitoring drone initiative. This mini-site is a responsive, accessible, and interactive single-page website created using only HTML5 and CSS3. It demonstrates modern web design techniques including CSS Grid, Flexbox, and CSS-only interactivity without JavaScript.

## Features

- Fully responsive layout with three breakpoints for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
- Semantic HTML5 structure including header, main, sections, forms, and footer.
- Interactive smart forms with styled inputs: text, email, checkboxes, radio buttons, select dropdowns, and textareas.
- CSS-only interactive components: toggle switches, accordion-style FAQs, and tabbed content.
- Accessibility best practices: keyboard focus, proper labels, and ARIA attributes where needed.
- Consistent theme with sea green, light blue, and dark blue colors.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. Interact with the page to test responsiveness, form inputs, toggles, accordions, and tabs.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` — The HTML markup file containing the entire site's content.
- `style.css` — The CSS file defining the layout, styling, and interactive components.
- `assets/` (optional) — Folder for images or custom SVG used in the project.

## Validation

- HTML and CSS validate with no errors using W3C Markup and CSS validators.

## Accessibility

- All form controls have associated `<label>` elements.
- Keyboard navigation is supported throughout interactive components.
- Focus styles enhance usability for keyboard users.

## Known Limitations

- The site currently does not include backend form handling; form submission URLs are placeholders.

## Future Improvements

- Add JavaScript for enhanced form validation and interactivity.
- Integrate backend or API for actual form data handling.
- Add animations or transitions for smoother UI effects.
- Optimize for SEO and deeper accessibility testing.
